           <p> In the beginning there was Te Korekore, the darkness where there was potential but as yet no life. Within Te Korekore lived Io the Supreme Being, Io who created numerous realms of Po, the night. Then the darkness gave way to Te Ata the dawn, from which the primal parents Papatūānuku, the Earth Mother and Ranginui; the Sky Father came into being. The firm embrace within which the parents held each other produced some seventy children all of whom became atua (gods). The children loved their parents but had to crawl between them and soon they yearned for space and light. The atua plotted to forcibly separate Papatūānuku and Ranginui with the task literally falling upon the shoulders of Tānemahuta, mighty god of the forests. At the moment Ranginui and Papatūānuku were parted the universe was created. All of the stars and planets came into being.</p>
